👋 Hi, I’m @akashFCB

👀 I’m a dedicated software engineer with a passion for crafting seamless user experiences. With two years of industry experience and a recent Master of Information Technology and Systems from the University of Canberra, I bring a blend of academic knowledge and practical skills to the table.

🌱 Currently, my focus lies on honing my expertise in Salesforce Development, while continuing to explore and expand my proficiency in Angular for front-end development.

💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of innovation and technology. Whether it's brainstorming new ideas or diving into code, I thrive in collaborative environments where diverse perspectives come together to create something extraordinary.
